        <center><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2024 shows a 2.7% increase compared to 2023, indicating a rise in consumer prices over the year; In 2023, 30-year mortgage rates reached a low of 6.09%. This year, they reached a peak of over 7%, meaning that the interest on homes are raising. Mortgage rates are a good way of measuring the increase of inflation in the current economic state, especially since they make up 45% of the Consumer Price Index.</p></center>
            <ul>
                <li>Food prices: Food prices were 2.4% higher than in November 2023</li>
                <li>Shelter prices: The shelter index increased 0.3% in November, accounting for nearly 40% of the monthly increase.</li>
                <li>Prices for all items excluding food and energy increased by 3.3% over the 12-month period.</li>
                <li>Impact of inflation: The average salary increase may not always keep pace with inflation.</li>
            </ul>
        <center><p>In conclusion, the price of food & other expenses are increasing at a rate faster than the salaries of the average citizen in the U.S. </p></center>
